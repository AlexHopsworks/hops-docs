MetaData Designer
===========================

Within the context of a project, click on the ``Metadata Designer`` button in the left-hand panel. It will bring up a metadata designer view that can be used to:

* Design a new Metadata Template
* Extend an existing Metadata Template
* Import/Export a Metadata Template

Within the Metadata Designer, you can define a Metadata template as one or more tables. Each table consists of a number of typed columns. Supported
column types are:

* string
* single-select selection box
* multi-select selection box

Columns can also have constraints defined on them. On a column, click on cog icon (configure), where you can make the field:

* searchable: included in the Elastic Search index;
* required: when entering metadata, this column will make it is mandatory for users to enter a value for this column.
