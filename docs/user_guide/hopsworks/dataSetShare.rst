===========================
Share a Data Set
===========================

Only a `data owner` or the `project owner` has privileges to share
Data Sets. To share a Data Set, go to the `Data Sets Browser` in your
project, and right-click on the Data Set to be shared and then select
the ``Share DataSet`` option. A popup dialog will then prompt you to
select (1) a target project with which the *Data Set* is to be Shared
and whether the *Data Set* will be shared as read-only (**Can View**)
or as read-write (**Can edit**). To complete the sharing process, a
Data Owner in the target project has to click on the shared Data Set,
and then click on ``Acccept`` to complete the process.
