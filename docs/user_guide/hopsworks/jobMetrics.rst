Job metrics
===========================

We provide live monitoring of your application with Grafana where you
can view metrics such as JVM memory consumption, Garbage Collection
activity, HDFS activity, completed tasks etc. After you have launched
your job, click on the ``Job UI`` button on the right and select the
``Metrics`` tab. A sample dashboard is illustrated below.

You can zoom in at any panel by left clicking, hold and drag across
the X axis. If you want to share the dashboard, click on the `Share
dashboard` button on the top which gives the options of sharing a
link, an interactive snapshot of your dashboard or exporting it in a
JSON format.
