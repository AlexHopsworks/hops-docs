Hops-YARN is very similar to Apache Hadoop YARN when it comes to using it. The goal of this section is to present the things that change. We first present some major features of Apache Hadoop YARN that have been removed or replaced in Hops-YARN. We then present how the different part of the YARN system (ResourceManager, NodeManager, Client) should be configured and used in Hops-YARN.
